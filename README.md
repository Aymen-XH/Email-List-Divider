# Email Divider

This Email Divider tool allows you to divide a list of emails from a text file into a specified number of parts and save each part to a separate file. It's a useful tool for managing and processing large email lists efficiently.

## Usage

1. Download the executable file `list_divider.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Aymen-XH/Email-List-Divider/releases) section of this repository.

2. Place the `list_divider.exe` file in the same directory as your mail list text file.

3. Double-click `list_divider.exe` to run the program.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts:

   - Enter the name of the mail list text file when prompted.
   - Enter the number of parts you want to divide the emails into.

5. The program will divide the emails into separate parts and save each part as a separate text file in the same directory.

6. You will see a success message indicating that the emails have been divided successfully.

## Example

Suppose you have a mail list text file named `mail_list.txt` containing a list of emails, and you want to divide it into 3 parts. Place `list_divider.exe` in the same directory as `mail_list.txt`, and run the program following the instructions above. You will get three separate text files named `emails_part1.txt`, `emails_part2.txt`, and `emails_part3.txt`, each containing a portion of the original email list.

## Note

Make sure the mail list text file and the `email_divider.exe` program are in the same directory for the program to work correctly.


Happy dividing!
